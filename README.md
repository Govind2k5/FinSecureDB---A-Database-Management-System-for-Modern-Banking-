# FinSecureDB---A-Database-Management-System-for-Modern-Banking-
"FinSecureDB" is a database management system designed for a modern banking application, architected to efficiently manage and secure core financial data using a SQL-based backend.  

The system maintains comprehensive information about customers, accounts, loans, transactions, branches, and employees, providing bank staff with a secure interface for viewing and managing data.  

It is designed to implement key database concepts such as stored procedures, functions, and triggers to automate critical operations like calculating interest, processing loan payments, and maintaining transactional integrity.  

The application supports full CRUD operations, including adding new customers, updating account details, and processing financial transactions. It also provides a foundation for analytical insights, such as generating customer statements, viewing loan portfolios, and tracking branch performance.  

This project demonstrates the practical application of database design, normalization, data integrity, and backend automation for a secure, real-world financial data management scenario.
